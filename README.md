#MedSafe: Your Personalized Health Companion
Problem
Today, managing personal health can be complex. Patients, especially those on multiple medications, face significant challenges:

Medication Non-adherence: It's easy to forget to take a dose, leading to inconsistent treatment.

Dangerous Interactions: Many people are unaware of potential interactions between their prescribed medications, over-the-counter drugs, or even common supplements.

Information Overload: It's difficult to find reliable, personalized health information without getting overwhelmed or confused by technical jargon.

These issues can lead to adverse health outcomes, reducing the overall effectiveness of a treatment plan and increasing the risk of complications.

Solution
MedSafe is a hackathon project designed to solve these problems by providing a simple, intelligent, and personalized web application for managing health and medications. The app focuses on empowering users to take control of their wellness journey with clear, actionable information.

Key Features
Multi-User Support & Personalization: MedSafe securely stores data for each user, allowing multiple individuals to use the same app instance. The app uses a simple profile selector to tailor its advice to different user personas (e.g., Woman, Senior Citizen, Girl Child).

Medication Interaction Checker: Users can input their prescribed medications and instantly check for potential interactions with any new drug or supplement they are considering. This core feature is crucial for preventing adverse drug events.

AI-Powered Wellness Assistants:

AI Chatbot: A trained AI chatbot provides friendly, general wellness advice based on the user's selected persona and age group. It helps users find concise information on health topics like PCOD or stress management.

Medication Information Generator: This tool uses an LLM to provide a quick, easy-to-understand summary of a medication, including its common purpose and side effects.

Symptom Assistant: Users can describe a symptom and get immediate, general information on managing it and when to seek professional medical help.

Voice Reminders: A voice-activated reminder feature uses text-to-speech to deliver audible reminders for medication times, making the app more accessible.

Real-time Statistics: The app tracks key metrics, such as medications added and interaction checks performed, giving users a live view of their progress.
